welcome to the bone zone, I fucking hate toyhouse <3

Idk who all is gonna see this, since I don't really plan on making this super public
but hi! I'm some freak on the internet, and one of many people who have been wrongly
banned from toyhouse.

If you're looking at this and have somehow dodged all that, TL;DR the site allows profiles
to be reported and banned for off site content that breaks terms of service onsite, even
if the end user adheres to terms onsite.

Beyond being hugely fucking weird that you're forced to comply with onsite terms anywhere
on the internet, the mod that manages the site has a long history of not doing their due
dilligance in checking if the reporter is doing so in good faith, and that the account
being reported is actually guilty, they are also known to be heavily biased against nsfw
and fetish artists, even when the fetish art in question adheres to the on site TOS.

Unfortunately, as of now there is no good alternatives, as the ones that do exist either
have higher limitations on what you can do with character and user profiles, and/or do
not allow nsfw.

So, in liew of making a real alternative bc servers are expensive and I'm a hobbyist with
no real expereince or education on coding besides my own, personal website. I made this.

This is technically the second version, but the first sucked ass and never left my 'puter.

What this is:
- a basic profile for your characters
- a simple, self hosted solution for character storage
- made to be mostly compatible with pre existing character codes.

What this is not:
- a perfect solution to character storage
- easy to use (not that the toyhouse profiles were either)
- a means to antagonize, rip off, or otherwise upset the creators, or users of toyhouse.

As much as I hate the website, I genuinely have no hate in my heart towards the developers,
moderators, or artists that use the site. This is meant to be a somewhat reasonable alternative,
nothing more, nothing less. If anyone who is officially involved in the maintaining or 
developing the website would like it modified to look less similar, or archived entirely,
I am more than happy to oblige.

Requirements:
- your favourite code editor (I'm fond of vscode)
- ideally, a little bit of html + css expereince
- the permission of the original creators of any html or css you plan to use.

Due to this project including the full code of a character profile, including all of the
navigaion bits that are usually hidden from users when using the on site html and css editors,
it is much more intimidating to look at initially. Hense why I reccomend a bit of css and
html knowledge. While I have done my best to clean up a lot of the more tangled bits of css,
and have simplified much of the profile html (since various portions of the code would not be
nescesary in an offline, self hosted enviroment) a large amount of said code remains, to maintain
as much compatibility as possible with existing user codes.

Complex html will not be plug and play, and you will likely need to make more adjustments than usual
to make the code compatible with this tool, this is especially true of code that makes use of
the toyhouse css import tool, as there is no way for that code to be aquired without the permission
of the original coder.

On that note, I am only responsible for the code directly included in this repo, and while I may 
eventually make some templates and example profiles, it will not be until after the base code is
complete and confirmed to be working.

Until then, users of this code are REQUIRED to get the express permission of the original creators of
any profile codes they choose to use.

Generally, this would be non commercial, private use for an offline character profile intended for 
use as an alternative archive. But change your wording to fit your needs (ESPECIALLY if you plan on making it any kind of public.)

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download the latest release of this tool by cloning the Github repo, or just downloading the raw data.
2. Place the files wherever you would like your character gallery to be
3. Load the character.html and, if applicable, the character.css files into your favourite code editor.

THINGS I WANT TO DO EVENTUALLY
[] Make several colour themes for the basic profile, including but not limited to
the themes already avalibe onsite
[] Make a fully custom example theme
[] Make several verified compatible themes
[] Make a whitelist of coders who are alright with their code being avalible off site
[] Remake the mobile side panel with functioning links
[] Make an image gallery base that isn't annoying to use and update
