welcome to the bone zone, I fucking hate toyhouse <3

Idk who all is gonna see this, since I don't really plan on making this super public
but hi! I'm some freak on the internet, and one of many people who have been wrongly
banned from toyhouse.

If you're looking at this and have somehow dodged all that, TL;DR the site allows profiles
to be reported and banned for off site content that breaks terms of service onsite, even
if the end user adheres to terms onsite.

Beyond being hugely fucking weird that you're forced to comply with onsite terms anywhere
on the internet, the mod that manages the site has a long history of not doing their due
dilligance in checking if the reporter is doing so in good faith, and that the account
being reported is actually guilty, they are also known to be heavily biased against nsfw
and fetish artists, even when the fetish art in question adheres to the on site TOS.

Unfortunately, as of now there is no good alternatives, as the ones that do exist either
have higher limitations on what you can do with character and user profiles, and/or do
not allow nsfw.

So, in liew of making a real alternative bc servers are expensive and I'm a hobbyist with
no real expereince or education on coding besides my own, personal webist. I made this.

This is technically the second version, but the first sucked ass and never left my computer.


Okay rambling done.

Install instructions:
1. download the latest release of Loverboy's Character Tool (LCT)
2. extract the zip into wherever you want to keep your characters (as the tool will incorperate a link into your character profile)
3. modify the character.html and, if nescesary, the character.css files to include the code you would like.
